## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.\
To do so, you will be modifying an existing `indexOf()` function.

### Existing files

| File path        | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/main.js`    | Contains some example uses of the `indexOf()` function. |
| `src/indexOf.js` | Contains the definition of the `indexOf()` function.    |

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

1.  In the `src/indexOf.js` file, implement a binary search algorithm that passes the tests.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
